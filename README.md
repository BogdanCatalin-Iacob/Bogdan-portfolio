| 4 |   User   | Easily get in contact   | Ask questions  |

-   ### Structure

    - All pages will have a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs them to a new page allowing users to navigate the site easily. The Nav Menu will be collapsible on a mobile device to make use of the space on smaller screens.<br>

    - Bootstrap framework will be used to make the website responsive on different devices and display organised content.
    All pages will be responsive and the layouts will change dependant on screen size. This is to ensure content flow is appealing, images are displayed properly and that the content is not shrunk side by side so small taht it is unreadable.<br>

    - All pages will contain a Footer element with Social Media links. The icons used will be from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). There are references below in the Technologies section of this document.<br>
